I am currently a second-year PhD student in the UC Riverside. My research interest mainly lies in continual learning and efficient AI on distributed systems. Previously, I worked 
in Amazon and Tencent as a software engineer. Before that, I spent two delightful years in the Simon Fraser University and obtained my Master degree there. 

If you are interested in my publications (or work experience), feel free to drop me an email :D
